# ML_Projects

This repository is a collection of various Machine Learning and Data Science projects ranging from web scraping to predictive modeling. Each project within this repository is self-contained and demonstrates different techniques and applications in the field of Machine Learning.

## Projects

### Web Scraping/Data Extraction:

- **Scraping Table from a Website**: Extracts structured data from HTML tables.
- **Scraping through Multiple Pages**: Demonstrates how to navigate and scrape data across multiple pages of a website.
- **Scraping Infinite Scrolling Websites**: Shows how to extract data from a website that loads content dynamically as the user scrolls.
- **Scraping Data from Twitter**: Uses the Twitter API to collect tweets for analysis.

### Machine Learning:

- **SMS Spam Classifier using NLP**: A natural language processing model to identify and filter spam messages.
- **Movie Recommender system**: Provides movie recommendations based on user preferences and past ratings.
- **Tweet Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of tweets - classifying them into positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Walmart Sales Prediction (Time Series)**: Uses time series analysis to forecast sales for Walmart.

### Data Analysis:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: A preliminary step in data analysis to summarize the main characteristics of the data.
- **Feature Engineering**: The process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data that will make machine learning algorithms work.
